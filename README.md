Robyul is build on top of [Karen, the highly efficient, multipurpose Discord bot written in Golang.](https://github.com/SubliminalHQ/karen)

## Selfhosting Robyul
Robyul is built on top of a lot of different components that make running your own instance rather complicated. Feel free to run your own local version of Robyul, but don't expect any help trying to get it to work.

## Development
Feature requests can be made on the Robyul Discord Server (https://discord.gg/s5qZvUV). PRs are welcomed and will likely be merged if the quality is good and the change fits into Robyuls feature set.
